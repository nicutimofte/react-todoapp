# React Todo APP Example

# You can try the app on [codepen.io](http://codepen.io/timoftealexandru05/pen/dXjrRj)

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.

## Running

The app is built with [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) and compiled at runtime for a lighter and more fun code reading experience. As stated in the link, JSX is not mandatory.
Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

### Static Files

You can store static files like images, fonts, etc in the `build` folder.

For example, if you copy a file called my_image.png into the build folder you can access it using `http://localhost:3000/build/my_image.png`.

### Dependencies

* React
* Webpack
* [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)
* [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
